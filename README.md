# Feline Finder

#### By William Chu

## Objective

- Take set of data about cat breeds and create interesting approach to filter it from a UI/UX perspective (within a web-based environment).

- Mobile-first. Feel free to use any tools/frameworks/libraries/etc that you would find useful.

## Planning & Thoughts

- Most folks do not know the proper name or the country of origin of a breed but are rather drawn to them by their coloring or fur. I thought it would be more enjoyable for a user to specify the latter and then see a changing list of cat breeds based on this information.

- JSON data appears a bit dirty, may need scrubbing or adjustment to make searches more accurate (some breeds have multiple fur lengths and patterns, some are missing data).

- To keep UI clean, I decided to introduce a glyph icon system that tells less common information like the origin of the breed. This could be expanded on in the future if more data points are added.
